/**
 * \brief Any time we change the tree structure, we need to call beginInsertRows() and endInsertRows() to notify
 *        other components that the model has changed.  This RAII class handles that for us.
 *
 *        NOTE that because \c QAbstractItemModel::beginInsertRows, \c QAbstractItemModel::endInsertRows,
 *        \c QAbstractItemModel::beginRemoveRows, \c QAbstractItemModel::endRemoveRows etc are protected, this class
 *        needs to be a friend of \c TreeModel.  (And this is why I didn't template this class on
 *        \c TreeModelChangeType, even though it's a constant known at compile-time -- because we'd end up with circular
 *        dependencies which would be a bit tiresome to eliminate.)
