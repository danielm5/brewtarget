/**
 * \brief Any time we change the tree structure, we need to call such things as \c beginInsertRows() and
 *        \c endInsertRows() to notify other components about the change to the model has changed.  This RAII class
 *        handles that for us.
 *
 *        There are several different types of change that can be handled - per \c TreeModelChangeType.  NOTE that we
 *        have to be careful only to make these calls when they are needed.  Eg, if you notify about layout change and
 *        row insertion together, you can put Qt internals in a funny state that results in crashes.
 *
 * \param parent is not required for \c changeType of \c ChangeLayout
 * \param first  is not required for \c changeType of \c ChangeLayout
 * \param last   is not required for \c changeType of \c ChangeLayout
 *
 *        NOTE that because \c QAbstractItemModel::beginInsertRows, \c QAbstractItemModel::endInsertRows,
 *        \c QAbstractItemModel::beginRemoveRows, \c QAbstractItemModel::endRemoveRows etc are protected, this class
 *        needs to be a friend of \c TreeModel.  (And this is why I didn't template this class on
 *        \c TreeModelChangeType, even though it's a constant known at compile-time -- because we'd end up with circular
 *        dependencies which would be a bit tiresome to eliminate.)
