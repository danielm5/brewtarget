    * \brief In an enumerated set, items are in a strict order and are accordingly numbered (starting from 1) with a
    *        step number, which is accessed via \c seqNum / \c setSeqNum.  \c OwnedSet::items returns items in this
    *        order.
    *
    *        In a non-enumerated set, the \c OwnedSet class does not manage the order of the items and returns them in
    *        arbitrary order.  (Typically there may be a weak ordering -- eg addition time for a \c RecipeAddition
    *        subclass or brew date for a \c BrewnNote -- but it is not managed inside of \c OwnedSet.
    *
    *        Note that \c setSeqNum has to take an optional second parmeter \c bool \c const \c notify (which should
    *        default to \c true).  This is because, in an enumerated set, we need to be very careful and controlled
    *        about when we (either directly or indirectly) emit signals from our member functions.
    *           If we are part way through modifying a sequence of steps (eg to swap two steps or insert a new one) then
    *        we do not want other parts of the code to read the steps when they are in an "in between" state.  Reading
    *        in such a state might either give incorrect data (eg two steps with the same step number) or, worse, make
    *        unwanted changes (eg normalising step numbers whilst we're in the middle of re-ordering steps).
    *           You might think that we can solve that with locks, but this is complicated because, usually, when we
    *        emit a signal, its slots are straight away run on the same thread before the signal function returns.  This
    *        means the thread that you want to prevent from reading the step sequence is the same one that is already
    *        modifying it.  So, instead, we ensure that whenever sequence numbers are being modified, no signal is
    *        emitted for the change of sequence number on each step.  Instead, a single \c changed signal for the whole
    *        set is emitted at the end.

 *          - an "ordered", aka "enumerated" list of "steps" - eg \c Mash ownership of \c MashSteps
 *
 *        For an "unordered" set, we do not have a strict ordering of the owned items (eg two hop additions could happen
 *        at the same time).
 *
 *        When the set changes, we emit the \c NamedEntity::changed signal on the \c owner object.
 *
 * \param Owner class needs to inherit from \c NamedEntity
 * \param Item class also needs to inherit from \c NamedEntity, plus implement: \c ownerId, \c setOwnerId
 *        For an enumerated set, \c Item also needs to implement \c seqNum, \c setSeqNum
 * \param propertyName is the name of the property that we use to signal changes to the size of the owned set (eg item
 *        added or removed).  It is typically the name of the property holding this \c OwnedSet object, but the value
 *        that we send with the \c changed signal is simply the new size of the set.
 * \param itemChangedSlot if not \c nullptr, is a member function slot on \c Owner that can receive
 *        \c NamedEntity::changed signals from \c Item objects in this set.  (Otherwise, if it is \c nullptr,
 *        \c Owner::acceptStepChange will be used.)  Typically that member function just needs to call our
 *        \c acceptItemChange function.  It is simpler to go via \c Owner because the owner object is able to call
 *        \c QObject::sender to get the sender and pass it to us.  (From looking at the Qt source code eg at
 *        https://github.com/qt/qtbase/blob/dev/src/corelib/kernel/qobject.cpp, it seems \c QObject::sender will return
 *        null if a slot on the object in question is not being invoked, so there is no use us trying to find ways to
 *        call \c this->m_owner.sender(), as we'll always just get back \c nullptr.)
